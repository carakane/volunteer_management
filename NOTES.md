ToDo
<!-- 1) class level ActiveRecord scope methods, e.g., # Cart.most_valuable.by_customer(@customer) -->

2) defend against invalid data

<!-- 3) nested resource must provide a form that relates to the parent resource -->

<!-- 4) Your forms should correctly display validation errors -->

<!-- 5) user will click on an organization and then want to see opportunities for that org at the same time -->

<!-- 6) when user views opportunity will want to be able to assign the opportunity to an available volunteer -->

<!-- 7) an available volunteer consists of same day free and no open opportunities -->

<!-- 8) need a way to adjust opportunity status -->

<!-- 9) opportunity status needs to be a drop down -->

<!-- 10) is volunteer pool specific to user? to org? or to whole app? -->

<!-- 11) if an opp is assigned its status must change from open -->

<!-- 12) another way to mark assigned opp as completed? -->

<!-- 13) new volunteer isn't set up correctly -->

<!-- 14) form field not blank -->

15) DRY

<!-- 16) partials -->

<!-- 17) create opp at org not defaulting to correct org -->

<!-- 18) edit opp vol label -->

<!-- 19) remove vol still assigned -->

<!-- 20) availability of vol worded differently -->
<!-- 21) day not on opp edit -->
<!-- 22) not all vols showing up??  -->
<!-- 23) put opps on vols show page -- NO -->

<!-- 24) broke vol availability -->

25) edit vol doesn't have yes days checked
<!-- 26) edit vol doesn't update correctly. -->
